# Heart_Disease_Prediction_System
/* This is my Personal project,Topic:- Heart Disease Prediction System Using Real Dataset Via Effective Machine Learning Technique, Language Used: Python,  Heart disease is one of the most fatal condition in the present world. High blood pressure, high Cholesterol, and smoking are key risk factors for heart disease. WORK:- Took the live real dataset of patients suffering from heart disease, Implemented a model to find out heart condition of multiple patients at once by generating a .csv file. This approach will be useful in hospitals., Did a statistical analysis of the inputs used in the model through data visualization., OBJECTIVE:-The main objective of this projects is to develop a heart predictions system. The system can discover if a person is suffering from a heart disease using real dataset. Heart Disease Prediction system aims to exploit logistic regression techniques on medical data set to assist in the prediction of the heart diseases. FUTURE SCOPE:- The use of machine learning to Detect heart disease is an essential activity, and it can be of assistance to both healthcare authorities and patients. It is an increasing area, and not much of it is reported because of the vast availability of patient data in hospital or clinics. */
